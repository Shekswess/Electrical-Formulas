# Electrical-Formulas

-This project is made for easier calculations of some electrical paramethers, or simply said it contains the most used formulas in electrical engineering

-The goal of this project is to make something simple but effective project.

-This Project is designed as short resume Project. This colection of formulas helped me a lot to get straight A's during my electrical engineering classes.

-Maybe this Project can be upgraded or better optimised but I'm satisfied.

-To run the project you need to have python3 installed. You download the code and you open the folder where the code is using the command line. You write:

# python main.py
To see all the options you need to open the code from a text editor or IDE !

-I hope you like this project and find it helpful !
